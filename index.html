  <section id="about" class="about">
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      We’re the Van Der Walts - Mum Billie, Dad Selwyn and our two little 
      adventurers, Bligh and Rothko. Until recently, we were living a “normal” life in
      Manchester: a house, jobs, routines and the kind of busy schedule
      most families know well. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But something kept tugging at us, we could feel life rushing by and we were missing out on precious time together. So in 2024, we made the biggest decision of our lives: we sold our house, let go of almost everything we owned and set off to explore the world as a family. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vision is simple; to <strong>worldschool</strong> our children, giving them the gift of learning from real places, people, and experiences. From temples in Thailand to cooking class in Vietnam - the world has become their classroom and every day brings new lessons through courage, kindness, and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, we’re slow travelling through Asia, finding that stability doesn’t have to come from a draining family routine, it can be from morning walks, meals together and bedtime stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve found that living with less possessions makes our souls (and suitcases!) feel lighter, and that “home” isn’t a place, it’s wherever we’re together. 
    </p>
    <p class="cta">
      If you’ve ever dreamed of stepping away from the ordinary and chasing something different - come wander with us. 
    </p>

        <h3>Abu Dhabi</h3>
        <p>
          With just a 14hr layover, Abu Dhabi gave us a memory for life.
          I reunited with my best friend after six years, and thanks to his work on
          <strong><em>TeamLab</em></strong>, he gifted us tickets and a private tour. The kids were amazed, and we adults had even more fun.

        <h3>South Korea</h3>
        <p>
          Between bustling Seoul streets and serene mountain temples at the border of North Korea,
          South Korea was full of contrast and discovery. The kids soaked up tradition while we adjusted to new rhythms. Stay tuned, our deep dive blog is on the way.

        <h3>Thailand</h3>
        <p>
          Our time in Thailand gave us temples, islands, community and epic indoor play areas
          From Phuket's heat and Chiang Mai's slow pace to Bangkok's tuk-tuks and flavours, it opened our eyes 
          to a whole new way of life, our deep dive blog is on the way.

        <h3>Vietnam</h3>
        <p>
          Vietnam challenged and inspired us daily. From unforgettable overnight train journeys,
           to cultural learnings that made us uncomfortable and stretched us in ways we
          didn't expect. Vietnam is billed at 'The next Thailand' and a haven for digital nomads, but there
          are a few things to seriously consider before making it your base. Full destination guide coming soon.

        <h3>China</h3>
        <p>
          China is the hardest and most rewarding place to visit. It picked us up, humbled us and changed our entire worldview - phew!
          We adored our time here and can't believe more families aren't singing it's praises for worldschooling... yet!
          We have a full breakdown of what you NEED to know before coming here - use our mistakes to make your trip there smooth. Fully comprehensive destination guide coming soon.
