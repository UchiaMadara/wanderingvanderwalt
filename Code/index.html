    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      We’re the Van Der Walts - Mum Billie, Dad Selwyn and our two little 
      adventurers, Bligh and Rothko. Until recently, we were living a “normal” life in
      Manchester: a house, jobs, routines and the kind of busy schedule
      most families know well. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But something kept tugging at us, we could feel life rushing by and we were missing out on precious time together. So in 2024, we made the biggest decision of our lives: we sold our house, let go of almost everything we owned and set off to explore the world as a family. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vision is simple; to <strong>worldschool</strong> our children, giving them the gift of learning from real places, people, and experiences. From temples in Thailand to cooking class in Vietnam - the world has become their classroom and every day brings new lessons through courage, kindness, and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, we’re slow travelling through Asia, finding that stability doesn’t have to come from a draining family routine, it can be from morning walks, meals together and bedtime stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re choosing memories over possessions and discovering that “home” isn’t a place, it’s wherever we’re together. 
    </p>
    <p class="cta">
      This journey is messy and magical and we’re loving sharing it. If you’ve ever dreamed of stepping away from the ordinary and chasing something different - come wander with us. 
    </p>

          <h3>Abu Dhabi</h3>
          <p>In just 14 hours, Abu Dhabi gave us a memory for life.  
          I reunited with my best friend after six years, and thanks to his work on <em>TeamLab</em>,  
          he gifted us tickets and a private tour. The kids were amazed, and we adults had even more fun.</p>

          <h3>South Korea</h3>
          <p>Between bustling Seoul streets and serene mountain temples, 
          South Korea was full of contrast and discovery. The kids soaked up
          traditions while we adjusted to new rhythms. Stay tuned — 
          our deep dive blog is on the way.</p>

          <h3>Thailand</h3>
          <p>Two weeks in Thailand gave us temples, museums, island sunsets, and even epic indoor play areas.  
          From Phuket’s heat to Bangkok’s tuk-tuks and flavors, it opened our
          eyes to a whole new way of life — our deep dive blog is on the way.</p>

          <p>Vietnam challenged and inspired us daily — from weaving through 
          motorbike traffic to tasting dishes that lit up our senses. A blog
          is in the works to share all the lessons and adventures we experienced
          here — our deep dive blog is on the way.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Depending on where you go – be prepared for jet lag to kick your butt and don’t overschedule yourselves for that first week or so. Even if you’re not travelling huge distances that first week is likely to be exhausting because of all the extra brainpower it takes just adjusting to a new place, navigating new foods and customs!
 Try and choose accommodation that has at least a separate living space with somewhere comfortable to sit, we didn’t account for how difficult it would be to go from a house to all living in one room and even taking out a few minutes for us when the kids were sleeping felt impossible. It’s a non-negotiable when it comes to accommodation now if we’re going to be there more than a day or two!

Don’t feel guilty for sticking to what you know! As much as we’d have loved it if the kids dove straight into local cuisine, it felt a little harsh to push that on them when so many things in their little lives had changed at once. So yes, we’ve had a takeout Mcdonalds or two. They slowly started trying new things at their own pace and we’re so glad we didn’t force it.</p>
